I'm a founding member and repository maintainer for [Crystal Linux](https://getcryst.al)

Currently, my server `falcon` is the build server and primary repository for the distro.

Don't have a Linux box? You're welcome to access my box Executor, either via a web-console [here](https://ssh.xhec.dev/?hostname=localhost&username=sandbox&password=c2FuZGJveA==) or
{% highlight bash %}
ssh sandbox@xhec.dev #password is 'sandbox'
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>
If you'd like a permanent account, you can: 
{% highlight bash %}
ssh register@xhec.dev #password is 'register'
{% endhighlight %}

Or, if you're already on the web console, then just
{% highlight bash %}
su register #password is still 'register'
{% endhighlight %}
