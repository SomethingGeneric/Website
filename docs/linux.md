I'm a founding core team member and repository maintainer for [Crystal Linux](https://getcryst.al)

I use Crystal on my laptop and desktop machines.

I mostly run Debian (or Proxmox {so amped up debian}) on my servers. (Occasional OpenBSD/FreeBSD for a laugh)

There's plenty of Linux/Arch/Crystal stuff on my GitHub!
