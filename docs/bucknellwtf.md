<p>Bucknell.wtf was an anonymous board where people could post anything. As you might expect, it got flooded with spam.</p>
<p>My origional purpose for creating this site was to offer an app like YikYak to those without iPhones. However, there's now a YikYak app for android.</p>
<p>As with basically everything else I've ever programmed, the code is available <a href="https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/yikchan">here.</a></p>
