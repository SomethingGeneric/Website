# Falcon
Falcon is a Debian 11 box on my home LAN, used for various non-critical things that I enjoy, but others don't depend on.

## TODO: List services/apps

## Past life:
In a past life, (aka not super long ago), falcon was a Crystal Linux server, not only the first machine to run Crystal long-term, but also the primary package build machine and main package server. This has thankfully since been offloaded to Bellator.
