# Falcon
Falcon is a Debian 11 box on my home LAN, used for various things.

## Services & apps
* Gamerbot's production instance
* https://memo.xhec.dev (source code is https://github.com/usememos/memos)
* TubeArchivist
* Personal Vaultwarden (https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) instance
* An instance of JMusicBot (https://jmusicbot.com/)
* Plex (not reaaaally used)

## Past life:
In a past life, (aka not super long ago), falcon was a Crystal Linux server, not only the first machine to run Crystal long-term, but also the primary package build machine and main package server. This has thankfully since been offloaded to Bellator.
